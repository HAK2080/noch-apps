# Noch — Pages Inventory

**Updated:** 2026-05-07. **Source of truth:** `src/App.jsx`. If you add a route, update this file.

This file maps every page in this repo to its file, URL, audience, and access gate. When you ask me about "the website" or "a page," check this first.

---

## TL;DR — what lives where

| Domain | Code lives in | Audience | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`apps.noch.cloud`** | **THIS REPO** (`src/`) | Staff (POS, dashboard) + Customers (storefront menu/checkout) | Mixed |
| **`noch.cloud`** | **NOT IN THIS REPO** — separate deploy | Customers (landing page, marketing) | Public |

**Rule of thumb:**
- Anything you can edit by changing files in this repo serves under `apps.noch.cloud`.
- The orange-and-rabbit landing at `noch.cloud` is **not** in this repo. If you want it changed, point me at where it's checked out.

The 4 mockup HTMLs at the repo root (`noch-storefront-mockup.html`, `noch-storefront-refined.html`, `noch-menu.html`, `noch-hub.html`) were design experiments — **deleted in commit `e89fe75`**. They were never deployed.

### Catch-all

| Route | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `*` | Redirect to `/` |

---

## Route guards

Defined in `src/App.jsx`:

| Component | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `ProtectedRoute` | Redirects to `/login` if not signed in |
| `OwnerRoute` | Redirects to `/my-tasks` if `profile.role !== 'owner'` |
| `RootRedirect` | At `/` — redirects owners to `/dashboard`, others to `/my-tasks` |

Note: the **canonical permission system** is `usePermission` + `PermissionsContext`, backed by the `role_permissions` table. `OwnerRoute` is a coarse gate; finer-grained checks happen inside the page (e.g. `can('pos', 'end_of_day')` in `POSEndOfDay`).

## Where the customer storefront actually lives

This is the most asked question. Three surfaces are sometimes called "the storefront":

1. **`noch.cloud` landing** — orange tile grid with the rabbit mascot. **NOT in this repo.** Hosted separately (different deploy). Edit at its own source.
2. **`apps.noch.cloud/menu/:branchId`** — the React menu page in this repo at `src/pages/storefront/Menu.jsx`. Has its own header (back-arrow + Noch logo + EN/AR toggle). This is what customers actually order from.
3. **`apps.noch.cloud/checkout/:branchId`** + **`/order-confirmation`** — the rest of the customer purchase flow.

Customer flow today:
```
noch.cloud  →  taps "المنيو"  →  picks branch  →  apps.noch.cloud/menu/<branch-uuid>
            →  cart  →  /checkout/<branch-uuid>  →  /order-confirmation
```

---

## Files that are NOT pages

For completeness, things that look like pages but are not routes:

- **POS components** under `src/modules/pos/components/` (BarcodeScanner, CartPanel, ManagerOverrideModal, PaymentModal, ProductGrid, ProductModifierModal, QRScanner, ReceiptModal, ShiftAttendees) — UI building blocks, rendered by the page above them.
- **`src/components/Layout.jsx`** — shared frame (sidebar + topbar) used by most internal pages.
- **`src/components/AppNav.jsx`, `Sidebar.jsx`, `Topbar.jsx`** — navigation chrome.
- **Ideas / Loyalty / Content sub-components** — same pattern, components inside page modules.

---

## How to add a new page

1. Create the page file under `src/pages/<group>/<Name>.jsx` (or `src/modules/<x>/pages/<Name>.jsx` if it belongs to a module).
2. Import + add a `<Route>` in `src/App.jsx`. Wrap with `ProtectedRoute` (and `OwnerRoute` if owner-only).
3. **Update this file (`docs/PAGES.md`).**
4. If the page introduces a new permission feature, add it to `role_permissions` via a migration.

If you skip step 3, this doc decays and we end up hunting again.
